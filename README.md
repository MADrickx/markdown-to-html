## A funny story

In 2018 or 2019 I was at the Rock Werchter festival, and we were at the Queens of the Stone Age concert, (it was UNBELEIVABLE tho) and at a certain point, that guy came crowdsurfing with a complete outfit of Spiderman, it was so hilarious that Joshua Homme event invited him on stage, cracked up a few jokes and all and went back at their music while giving backstage access to SpiderMan. Trully a nice day!

### TL;DR

Went to a QOTSA concert, a dude with a Spiderman outfit came up, went on stage and finished with backstage access.
